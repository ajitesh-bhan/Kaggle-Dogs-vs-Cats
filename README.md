Kaggle challange trained Neural Network and Code 


The code.pynb contains a path location replace it wih tour system path of folder wher train and test1 data sets are located
This is convolutional Neural Network 
I the code the train and test data sets gets saved as .npy thus saving the need of preprocessing everytime, once run the complete code for create data set then going forward .npy could be used.
